# Contributing to Version Catalogue

We appreciate your interest in contributing to our Java Enterprise Utility Library. Contributions are welcome in various
forms such as code, documentation, bug reports, and test cases. To ensure a smooth collaboration, please follow the
guidelines outlined below.

## Getting Started

The Java Dev Kit is an open-source Java library designed to ease Java enterprise application development. It is built
with Java 17, and we require contributors to use OpenJDK 17.

## Development Setup

There is no need for manual setup beyond ensuring you have JDK 17 and a stable internet connection. Our project uses
Gradle Wrapper for building, simplifying the setup process.

```shell
./gradlew build
```

## Branching Strategy

We follow the `git-flow` branching model. Contributors should fork this repository and create their work on separate
branches prefixed with `feature/` or `hotfix/` as appropriate.

## Code Style

Please adhere to the coding standards specified in our `.editorconfig` file in the root of the repository. Consistent
style helps in maintaining readability and uniformity across the codebase.

## Commit Messages

We require that commit messages follow this structure:

```text
type[(scope)]: subject

[body]

[BREAKING CHANGE: breaking changes]
```

This format helps in auto-generating changelogs and understanding the purpose behind changes.

## Submitting Contributions

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature` or `git checkout -b hotfix/my-fix`.
3. Make your changes and commit them.
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/my-new-feature`.
5. Create a Pull Request with a succinct subject and a detailed body.

## Testing

We encourage using JUnit Jupiter for unit and integration tests. Pull Requests with accompanying test reports are prioritised for review and merging.
